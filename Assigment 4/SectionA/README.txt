Attached with the project are .exe files for relative codes:

GeneticLearningTree - XOR - A&B .exe-> for XOR
GeneticLearningTree - NXOR - C.exe -> for not XOR
GeneticLearningTree - ONE-ZERO-C.exe -> for A&!B
GeneticLearningTree -ZERO-ONE-C.exe -> for !A&B
GeneticLearningTree - Univariate-D.exe -> for x^2+x+1



the results will be in out.txt

Also included are .txt files that we got after we ran the .exe above.

Thanks
